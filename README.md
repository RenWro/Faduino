# Faduino

The Faduino is a DIY MIDI controller inspired in the Presonus Faderport. It has one motorized fader, a rotary encoder and several silicone buttons, plus two PCBs. One PCB contains all the pads, which are triggered by the silicone buttons, addressable LEDs, a multiplexer, and some other stuff.
It can control natively any DAW, because it works with the MCU - or Mackie - Protocol, so it can work even in Pro Tools. With its motorized fader, rotary encoder, and LED buttons, you can change the track and the parameters in DAW get updated in the controller, moving the motorized fader, changing LEDs, etc.
With the Faduino you can control any channel strip, transport, and many other things in the DAW!
